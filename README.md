This packages holds tooling that I frequently use to put together Node web applications.

The resources here are implemented on top of libraries such as:
- [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
- [AWilix](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix)
- [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi)

This package is tipically used togetheter with other personal projects of mine, such as the following:
- [@thomazmz/core-context](https://github.com/thomazmz/core-context)  
- [@thomazmz/core-utils](https://github.com/thomazmz/core-utils)  
- [@thomazmz/mongo-repository](https://github.com/thomazmz/mongo-repository)  
- [@thomazmz/joi-utils](https://github.com/thomazmz/joi-utils)
